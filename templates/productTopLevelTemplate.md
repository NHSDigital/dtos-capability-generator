<h2>Test-Products</h2>

<p>Products allow a group of <a href="https://nhsd-confluence.digital.nhs.uk/display/DTS/Users+and+Personas">users</a> to perform certain actions to achieve a defined output. They contain a bounded and grouped set of features which an organisation can easily communicate and which 'make sense' internally and to its users.

It may support multiple points in the overall value stream. This is NOT necessarily the branded name or acronym of a supplied application (in each screening programme, these applications may be implementations of this product). E.g. Cohort Manager</p>

<h2>Product Boundaries</h2>

The introduction to the service blueprint (Target Service Blueprint) covers the relationship between business capabilities and product features. It touches on the fact that the mapping between products and business capabilities can be influenced by a number of different factors, these factors include:

<ul>
    <li><b>Pathway agnostic products</b> - Preference for products that work independently of the pathway vs products with pathway awareness​</li>
    <li><b>Product isolation</b> - Preference for loosely coupled products with little to no dependencies vs highly-coupled products​</li>
    <li><b>Single responsibility</b> - Preference for clearly bounded products vs those with unclear scope​</li>
​</ul>

<h2>Overarching System Context</h2>

The diagram below illustrates the overarching System Context View of all the Products. The Products in isolation do not deliver an end to end screening pathway, only by understanding their role in the wider ecosystem is it possible to deliver a National Screening Platform

The overarching system context is large and does look complex, therefore for the purposes of improving consumption we have a more product centric context view below
